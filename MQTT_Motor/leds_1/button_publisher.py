'''button_publisher.py 
I run led_mqtt_server.py  on the pico with a pushbutton on pin 16

on the other picoW I have the led_mqtt_server.py with the led on pin 16.  I used main.py to trigger calling the program
when I hold the button to 1 when powered on.

## first is for regular button press, below this is for long button press
